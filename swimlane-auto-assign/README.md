# Swimlane Auto-Assign

This script is useful for workflows where each team member has it's own swimlane.
Simply include team member's name in the swimlane name (i.e. "Swimlane for John Doe's tasks"), and tasks will get automatically assigned to "John Doe" once moved into his swimlane.
Alternatively, you can also use @initials syntax instead of providing full name - i.e. "Swimlane for @JD".
